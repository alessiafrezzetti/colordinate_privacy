We do not collect information such as IP addresses, app usage statistics, or device identifiers.

This app requests permission to access your Photos Library solely to save your digital generated postcard. This permission is only used for saving images and is not used to access, collect, or upload any other data.

This app does not use cookies or similar technologies. All interactions occur locally on your device.


**Advertisement and Other Third Parties**

Colordinates contains no third-party advertising and does not use any analytics or tracking SDKs. No data is shared with third parties.

Since we do not store or transmit your data, your personal information is protected by default. All app functionality happens locally and no external storage or cloud connection is used.


**Changes To This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 22, 2025 and will remain in effect unless revised. If we make any significant changes, we will update this page and inform users through the App Store or in-app notice if necessary.
